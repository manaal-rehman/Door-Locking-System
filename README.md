# Door-Locking-System

In this project, I designed a locking system to provide security and control access authorization to the user with the aid of microcontroller; Arduino UNO in our case. The user was required to enter a password through a keypad which was displayed on an LCD. If the password was correct, microcontroller would send a signal to the actuator (Servo Motor) to open the door. If user presses '#' the microcontroller would send a signal to the actuator (Servo Motor) to close the door.
